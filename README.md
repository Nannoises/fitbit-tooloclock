# fitbit-tooloclock

Here I'm going to develop a clock based on my personal needs, but any contribution is welcome and if you want to collaborate just ping me, we can plan together a different roadmap. :)

## Roadmap / ideas

- [ ] Show a simple clock and one metric (cardio)
- [ ] 2 configurable toggles for reminders (use case: do I have took the pill? have I given to my baby the vitamin D today?...), behaviour: they set to Off on midnight, on switch On is logged the datetime and the switch pressed
- [ ] Settings to configure the 2 toggles (name, color, enable/disable)
- [ ] Configure and show a second timezone
- [ ] Configure metrics for the clock
- [ ] Improve design and usability
- [ ] backend to collect the logs of the toggle
- [ ] frontend to visualise the logs (month view)
- [ ] (?) daily mood tracker
- [ ] button to log a time (long press to retrieve previous time) (use case: i'm feeding the baby now, when i feeded last time?)
- [ ] make 4 buttons configurable between 3 types: toggle, mood tracker, time log
